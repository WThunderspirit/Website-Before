			<p>I put this little site together to show off what I know at this point; before my education and career path begin.  For me, this is a progressive tool to mark how far I've grown.</p>
			<p>Although I come from mostly a web design philosophy, which began with "HTML 4.0 for Dummies" and included Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer Browsers through which it was rendered in that era, my long break saw the advancement of Javascript from being a DOM dependant language to something more flexible; and usable by many platforms.</p>
			<p>I became somewhat versed in Javascript programming and CSS after fully digesting the HTML course studies, satisfying the curious hobby with a series of 'For Dummies' books, W3 Online Schools, and very adept use of Google-fu; eventually learning PHP and MySQL, as well as operating various free and paid servers, and FTP management.  I tried to learn Perl for email handling, but honestly - that code was a little advanced for my taste - not being very friendly for self-teaching.  The same was true of the Apache servers, and XML I only had a vague understanding of, though it didn't seem too different from HTML and boggled me for its use versus HTML.</p>
			<p>I took a long break from the hobby after a while, but the hobby didn't stop growing.  Languages - especially Javascript - grew tremendously, as did attributes, methods, styles, tags, and functions.  The possibilities are endless, it seems, from the old days and old ways of doing things.</p>
			<p>My credentials DO NOT extend to the creative arts, except for writing.  I have made many functional, but quite ugly websites!  Sadly, visual arts?  Not my thing.  I will always need a web designer next to me to make things 'pretty'.  That's ok - I like the nuts and bolts anyway.  I like to bring flat and lifeless to vibrant life and robust interactivity.  I want clients to see their product as a means to attract their customers, safely, securely, and satisfyingly.</p>
			<p>In light of the recent release from my former employer for their lack of foresight and fiscal responsibility and integrity resulting in an entire department being let go; I've come to the conclusion that my hobby is a lucrative and meaningful means to a bright future.  Thus why I'm glad to finally be heading for a career in Web Development and Applications.</p>
